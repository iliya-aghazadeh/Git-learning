1-Run git in a folder --> "git init"
    by using the command in the terminal
    now git is tracking all the changes in this folder


2- seeing the changes from the latest verion --> "git status"
    this will tell what changes has been done since the previous version

3- choosing what features to add from the previous version --> "git add"
    pick which changes to have from the last version 
    --> if we only a file to be added, it will add that file but if we choose a folder to be add, it will add that folder and all it's files and sub folders
    --> to add everything, we can use "git add ."

4- giving the new version --> "git commit -m "Version 1.1.1" 

5- to add something to the previous version : 
    1- we first make the changes 
    2- then we add the changes : "git add ."
    3- we will give it to the previous file : git commit -m "Version 1.0.0." --amend

6- when we add some changes, they will be shown in Stage Changes and the changes that are not added yet will be shown in Changes

7- Remove a Stage change and bring it back to (unstaged) Changes area --> "git reset Learning.txt"

8- undo the changes made in a file --> git checkout -- file_name or .
    *** changes can be made for the files that are not staged ***

9- to go to a specific version --> git checkout commit_hash
